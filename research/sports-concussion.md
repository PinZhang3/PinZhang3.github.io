Sports-related concussions (SRC) are common in the United States. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are 1.6â€“3.8 million SRC per year, with the highest concussion rates found among contact sports such as ice hockey, football, soccer, and basketball. The lab is participating in a multisite project conducted by BrainScope to develop a Multimodal Concussion Assessment Device by collecting data that will be used to correlate changes in EEG to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in sport concussions.
