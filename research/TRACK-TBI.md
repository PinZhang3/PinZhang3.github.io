Our lab is involved in a multi-site longitudinal study designed to collect clinical, imaging, genetic, proteomic, and neuropsychological data on traumatic brain injury.  The Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) is a large and complex project, comprised of 11 clinical sites and 7 Cores.  

Each year in the United States approximately 1.7 million people sustain a TBI and effective treatment has yet to be discovered.  Traumatic brain injury is a contributing factor to one-third of injury-related deaths, as well as a contributing factor to long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological disabilities.  To this date, there have not been any successful clinical trials or treatments.  This failure has been linked to the outdated and blunt TBI classification system.  

The goal of TRACK-TBI is to create a large, high quality database that integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic and outcome biomarkers to improve TBI classification/taxonomy and outcome assessments, identify the health and ecomonic impact of mild TBI patient disposition, and create a legacy database with analytic tools and resources to support TBI research.
