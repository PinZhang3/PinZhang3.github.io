Our work in this area aims to understand how age-related cognitive changes may be mediated by rest-activity cycles. Using actigraphy, we assess how rest-activity measures, especially rhythm fragmentation, are related to neural markers that play a role in decision making and associative learning. In collaboration with the [Worthy Lab](https://worthylab.org/) and [Caprock fMRI Lab](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/psy/caprockscience/), we hope to better understand how the neural and computational mechanisms involved in history-dependent and history-independent decision making may differ across the lifespan. In addition, through collaboration with the [Preston Lab](https://clm.utexas.edu/preston/) we aim to investigate the role of rest-activity rhythms in hippocampal pattern completion in memory-based decision making ([Preston and Mack, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702775)).
