# About Our Lab

Our research is focused on the Cognitive Neuroscience of mental processes. Studies are approached using a broad range of methodological tools â€“ human lesions, structural and functional MRI, and electrophysiology (MEG/EEG). We examine the cognitive and neural systems that support memory and attention control in young and old healthy individuals as well as persons suffering from mental illness and traumatic brain injury.

# New Book to Be Released from Oxford University This Year

The purpose of this book is to present state-of-the-art scientific research in human performance optimization (HPO). Our aim is to provide a clearer understanding of the physical, psychological, and social effects on human functioning presented by the challenges of performing in extreme settings. At the same time, we seek to explore solutions for optimizing human performance in these settings. While the genesis for this book lay in military policymaking, the optimization of human performance through applied science and engineering will yield benefits to a broad spectrum of human activities.
