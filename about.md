# About Our Lab

Our research is focused on the Cognitive Neuroscience of mental processes. Studies are approached using a broad range of methodological tools â€“ human lesions, structural and functional MRI, and electrophysiology (MEG/EEG). We examine the cognitive and neural systems that support memory and attention control in young and old healthy individuals as well as persons suffering from mental illness and traumatic brain injury.
