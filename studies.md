### Now Recruiting Healthy Adults - Facial Perception and Eye Tracking Study

In our daily lives we interact with many different people. Different cognitive factors can affect our perceptions of the people we encounter on a daily basis. We want to know more about the cognitive factors that influence our perception of others. <br>

We are currently seeking healthy adults to participate in an eye tracking study on perceiving people. Participants will be paid $15 for a session (approximately 1 hour). <br>

### Now Recruiting Ages 18-30 - Sleep and Activity Monitoring through Wearable Assessment

The purpose of the study is to investigate the validity of wearable and home health electronics for measuring rest-activity cycles and sleep composition. <br>

We are currently seeking healthy adults ages 18-30 who are willing to wear 2 activity monitoring devices (eg., Fitbit) for 2 weeks. Participants will be compensated $50 and will receive a personalized sleep-activity report. <br>

### Now Recruiting Ages 60-90 - Aging, Sleep, and Cognition

The purpose of this project is to examine the relationships between aging, sleep-wake cycles, and cognition. Each participant will wear an actigraph, or wristwatch-like device, that will measure sleep-wake cycles and daily activity. This study involves a commitment of 10-14 days total, with 2 in-lab sessions and 10 days of actigraph recording as participants go about their daily life. One in-lab session is completed before participants begin wearing the actigraph wristwatch (2 hours). One additional session is completed within two weeks after the first session (3-4 hours).

We are currently looking for older adults **between the ages of 60 and 90** to participate. Participants will be compensated up to $10 per hour and parking will be paid for. Each participant will also receive a picture of his or her brain and a personalized sleep-activity report.
