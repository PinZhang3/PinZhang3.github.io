### Now Recruiting Ages 60-89 - Sleep and Activity Monitoring through Wearable Assessment

The purpose of the study is to investigate the validity of wearable and home health electronics for measuring rest-activity cycles and sleep composition. <br>

We are currently seeking healthy adults ages 60-89 who are willing to wear 2 activity monitoring devices (eg., Fitbit) for 2 weeks. **All study activities will take place through contactless procedures.** Participants will be able to keep a Fitbit Charge 2 HR device as compensation for their involvement in the study. They will also receive a personalized sleep-activity report. <br>

### Aging, Sleep, and Cognition - Recruitment ON HOLD due to COVID-19

The purpose of this project is to examine the relationships between aging, sleep-wake cycles, and cognition. Each participant will wear an actigraph, or wristwatch-like device, that will measure sleep-wake cycles and daily activity. This study involves a commitment of 10-14 days total, with 2 in-lab sessions and 10 days of actigraph recording as participants go about their daily life. One in-lab session is completed before participants begin wearing the actigraph wristwatch (2 hours). One additional session is completed within two weeks after the first session (3-4 hours).

We enroll older adults **between the ages of 60 and 89** to participate. Participants will be compensated up to $10 per hour and parking will be paid for. Each participant will also receive a picture of his or her brain and a personalized sleep-activity report.
