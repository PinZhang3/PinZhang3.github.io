[Add your blog content here]

Instructions:

1) Create a new file in the format "YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md" in the _drafts folder. 
2) Then copy all the contents of this file (template.md) into your new file. 
3) Make sure you:
    - change the date/time (date variable) 
    - change the title of the post (title variable)
    - change the catergory (category variable)
    - do NOT change the layout variable
    (All these variables can be found at the top of the file)
4) Once you have finished writing out your post, move your markdown file to the _posts folder where it will then be automatically published to the site.
