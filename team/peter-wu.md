Peter is a postdoctoral fellow with the Whole Community Whole Health grand challenge initiative and the Institute for Mental Health Research of the University of Texas at Austin. With mentors and collaborators in psychology, medicine, and engineering, he is working to create novel methodologies to mine personal sensing data from smart, mobile and wearable devices for mental health inference and treatment. Before joining UT Austin, he completed a doctoral degree in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia, where he focused on the theories and methods of processing social signals data captured in cyber-human systems such as physical proximity encounters, tech-mediated communications, and online social networks. He has strong interests in using sensing technology to measure the ways people naturally engage in social interactions and respond to social stimuli as well as using machine learning to uncover their connections with and impact on health, cognition, and performance.
