Lupita is a fourth-year graduate student in the Cognitive Neuroscience lab under the direction of Dr. David Schnyer. She received her B.A. in Psychology and Business Administration with a Neuroscience certificate at Bethel College in Kansas. As a graduate student, she is a member of the psychology department’s Diversity Committee and mentors undergraduates through the psychology department’s Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and UT’s IE Pre-Graduate Program.

Lupita’s research interests include the use of neuroimaging methods to examine racial biases in socio-cognitive processes. Her previous research used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate racial biases in attention and working memory. Lupita’s current research examines how social contexts influence perceptions of racial ingroup and outgroup members, as well as, one’s willingness to interact with racial outgroups. She is also using eye-tracking to examine how the social context influences racial biases in visual attention.
