He graduated from Michigan State University in 2014, earning a Bachelor of Science in psychology with a specialization in cognitive science. At MSU, Nicholas was a research assistant in the Sleep and Learning Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Kimberly Fenn. He also worked as the lab manager for this lab from 2013-2014, and completed his honors thesis on false memory for information encoded via social media.
