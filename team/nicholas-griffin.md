Nicholas Griffin is a fifth year graduate student working with Dr. David Schnyer in the Cognitive Neuroscience area of the psychology department at the University of Texas at Austin. He graduated from Michigan State University in 2014, earning a Bachelor of Science in psychology with a specialization in cognitive science. At MSU, Nicholas was a research assistant in the Sleep and Learning Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Kimberly Fenn. He also worked as the lab manager for this lab from 2013-2014, and completed his honors thesis on false memory for information encoded via social media. While at UT, Nicholas has contributed to research projects including MRI data collection and behavioral analyses for a longitudinal traumatic brain injury study, and EEG data collection and management for a study investigating cognitive and biological predictors of developing future depression. Nicholas also earned a Master of Arts in psychology from UT in August 2017. His dissertation research program uses behavioral and EEG methods to investigate false memory for emotional stimuli in individuals with negative attention bias, including individuals in a negative mood state and individuals with depressive symptoms.
