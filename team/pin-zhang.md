# __Bio__
[Pin ZHANG](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/zhangpin/) is the Assistant Professor under the [Presidential Young Professorship](https://www.nus.edu.sg/careers/nus-programmes/) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Before joining NUS, Dr ZHANG worked at the University of Cambridge as the Royal Society Newton International Fellow (2022-2024). He completed the Ph.D. from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in 2022, including one year at the University of Oxford as a visiting scholar.  

His research focuses on (1) intelligent computational geomechanics, aiming to develop knowledge-informed AI approaches to reshape the fundamental framework of computational geomechanics, covering constitutive modelling, integration algorithms, solvers, etc; and (2) the application of artificial intelligence in geotechnical engineering, with particular emphasis on sustainable geomaterials, tunnelling, and coastal geotechnics.
