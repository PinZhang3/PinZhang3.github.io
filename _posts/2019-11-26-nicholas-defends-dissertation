Last week, one of the graduate students in the Schnyer Lab, Nicholas Griffin, successfully defended his dissertation on false memory for emotional words in individuals with negative biases. 
His research examined a variation of the commonly used DRM false memory paradigm, explored the mechanisms of false memory with EEG, 
and induced mood state to determine causal roles of current mood on false memory outcomes.

Nicholas also completed the Insight Data Science fellowship this fall, in preparation for transitioning to a career in data science.

If you see Nicholas around, be sure to wish him congratulations!
