Congratulations to Lupita Gonzalez, now Dr. Gonzalez, for successfully defending her dissertation on The Effects of Social Contexts on Racially Biased Cognitive and Socio-Emotional Processes.
Lupita is the daughter of immigrants and a first-generation high-school, college, and graduate student. In her dissertation, she used eye-tracking to investigate how competitive social contexts influence attention and memory for racial ingroup and outgroup members, as well as, one’s willingness to interact with racial outgroups
